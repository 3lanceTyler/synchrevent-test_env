    <h2>What is Synchrevent?</h2>
    <p>Simply put, Synchrevent is a platform designed to synchronise your key event data in-real time whilst your project is in execution.<br />
    With tools allowing you to share key and important information, issue notificaiton, recieve and responde to incident reports to head counting. Synchrevent provides key tools to help your events run smoothly.</p>

    <h2>Synchrevents Vision and Goals</h2>
    <p>Our aim is to introduce fluidity and syncronisity to your events. We know that some venues can be vast in scale, and the relay of information due to that can be slow.<br />
    Well no more! As long as you have a smartphone with internet access, you can seemlessly connect to an event page to view and relay information effortlessly.</p>

    <h2>Where Synchrevent wants to go</h2>
    <p>We want to continue adding and improving features for our platform ensuring our we continue to provide valuable tools making events just that little bit easier to manage.</p>
